<p>After being in Oxford for almost three months now we have been getting a bit of an itch to get out and explore the UK again. We decided the perfect place to relax and see something new was Brighton - the classic British seaside resort!</p>

<p>After a two hour drive from Oxford we arrived in the wonderful city of Brighton. As we drove into the city we passed through the hilly suburbs of Brighton covered in large, wealthy home, and eventually ended up in the trendy, beach-side resort town.</p>

<p>That night we look a walk along the water and up Brighton pier. We'll have to go back again on a sunny summer day!.</p>

<p>The next day we explored the famous Brighton Laines (the name of the district full of lanes) and the Royal Pavilion. The area is full of fun, small, interesting shops, such as the chocolate haven, Choccywoccydoodah. We also had a lot of fun exploring the quirky Royal Pavilion, which was a former royal residence decored in an European/Asian style.</p>

<p>That night we stayed about 30 minutes out of Brighton in a place called Peacehaven in a wonderful little AirBnB flat. It felt like the home that we really wanted and we really didn't want to leave. The next day we explored the white chalk cliffs at Peacehaven and Seven Sisters - quite a spectacular and peaceful place.</p>``

<p>That afternoon we drove the New Forest and stayed there for the night. It was a magical place - wild horses and donkeys roam free around a beautiful old forest that was once a royal hunting ground. We went on several short walks and were lucky enough to see some majestic bucks (male deers) passing through the forest! We we certainly we going back to the New Forest again!</p>
