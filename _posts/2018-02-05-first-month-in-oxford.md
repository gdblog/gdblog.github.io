<p>Hard to believe, but it has now been one month in Oxford! We have been very busy so far, getting our lives organised in a completely new country is a lot of work!</p>

<p>I have been settling into University well, but there is a much to learn and a bit mindset shift to make. Research really is a different world when compared to industry, and I need to get back into the mindset of learning, creating, and being agile in very large amounts of uncertainty. Uncertainty I think is one of the defining characteristics of research - uncertainty of what will work, uncertainty of how to do something never done before, & uncertainty of what you should do. But it is exciting and I have no regrets!</p>

<p>I have also been exploring the university and recently found the Duke Humphrey's library, which is part of the Bodleian Library system. What an incredible place to study!</p>
