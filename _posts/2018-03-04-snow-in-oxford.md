<p>It's snowing Oxford! Apparently this only happens every few years and this year we have been lucky enough to see it multiple times! It really is surreal to see snow in the city, and to see how the city responds to all this frozen water (England just generally shuts down when it snows!).</p>

<p>It is also one of the first times that we have both really experienced falling snow. We quickly realised how fun it is to play it, but how annoying it is when you are trying to go about your normal business. Who knew - snow is just frozen water!</p>
