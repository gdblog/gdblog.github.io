<p>Today we finally arrived in Oxford, after travelling around the UK for the last 2.5 weeks. It was a surreal, wonderful feeling to finally be here after so much preparation and research.</p>

<p>We have spent almost 18 months now researching, applying, planning and filling in endless paperwork to reach this point. When we first saw the "Welcome to Oxford" sign we both thought <i>we are finally here!</i> We are now in our new home (for at least the next two months) and preparing for our life in Oxford. So much to organise, but it is all so exciting and new! For example, we need to get the basics for our home, set up bank accounts, plans for our phone, register with the uni, and so much more.</p>

<p>We really are some lucky people to have this opportunity in life, an opportunity which is just a distant dream to most. We must make the most of our time here and really live life to the fullest!</p>

<p>Until Next Time,
GD</p>
